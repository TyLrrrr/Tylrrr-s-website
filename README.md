# Tylrrr's-website
Working on my own website, its going to be sort of like a blog on my creating of the website. I'll add in some example websites I make and hopefully use this to sell myself for a future job.

If you want to look at the code feel free, I'll continue to add to it while I go to school. Make a few web apps, add a database to it in the future and really flush it out ot get hands on experience.
